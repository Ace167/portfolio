    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This crowd-pleasing recipe features chicken seared alongside asparagus, yielding beautifully
      golden meat and tender-crisp stalks. After searing the chicken, the pan is deglazed with
      shallot, white wine, thyme, and broth, creating a flavorful base. The chicken and asparagus
      then return to the pan, which goes straight from stovetop to oven in an oven-proof skillet.
      The final dish is a creamy, nourishing meal, offering a delightful balance of peppery, fresh,
      and slightly tangy notes from the crème fraîche.
    </p>
    <p>
      It pairs wonderfully with rice, pasta, or potatoes. Feel free to customize the flavors by
      experimenting with different cheeses like Pecorino, Manchego, or Asiago instead of Parmesan.
      If white wine isn't available, white wine vinegar can achieve a similar effect. Enjoy
      experimenting with herbs like cayenne, dill, garlic, parsley, sage, or tarragon, which
      complement both chicken and asparagus. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the
      refrigerator for up to three days.

      <li>3/4 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
      <li>4 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons chicken broth</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped shallot</li>
      <li>1/4 cup dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)</li>
      <li>3 thyme sprigs, plus leaves for garnish</li>
      <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 3-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 cup creme fraiche or sour cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese/li></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Whisk together flour and granulated garlic in a shallow bowl or baking dish until combined.
        Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Working with 1 chicken breast at a
        time, dredge chicken in flour mixture to coat both sides, and shake off excess; set aside on
        a large plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil and butter in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Once butter is melted and
        shimmering, add chicken breasts to skillet, and cook until golden brown on both sides, about
        8 minutes. Transfer to a clean plate. Do not wipe skillet clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        While chicken browns, transfer remaining flour mixture to a small bowl. Add 3 tablespoons
        chicken broth, and whisk until smooth to make a slurry; set aside until ready to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat under skillet to medium; add shallot, and cook, stirring constantly, until
        softened, about 30 seconds. Add wine, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of skillet,
        about 1 minute. Stir in thyme sprigs and 1 cup broth. Gradually whisk in slurry mixture
        until combined; bring to a simmer around edges of skillet over medium-high. Remove skillet
        from heat. Add browned chicken to the skillet; arrange asparagus around chicken, and
        immediately transfer skillet to the preheated oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until asparagus is tender and a thermometer inserted into
        thickest portion of chicken registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes. Remove
        from the oven, and divide chicken evenly among 4 plates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir crème fraîche and Parmesan into asparagus and broth mixture until fully combined. Spoon
        asparagus and cream sauce over chicken. Garnish with thyme leaves.
